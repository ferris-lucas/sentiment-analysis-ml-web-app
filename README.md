<h1>Project of a Web App that performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews based on a machine learning model</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
This API receives data input (movie reviews) and outputs a prediction whether the sentiment of the reviewer of the title was Positive or Negative. The prediction is done by a model developed with XGBoost, using IMDB dataset available online. The trained model was serialized and uploaded to the site.
